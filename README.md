# String Occurrence Counter

This Python script searches through a given directory and all its subdirectories for text files. It then counts the occurrences of each word (string) in those files and displays only those words that appear more than twice, sorted by the number of occurrences in descending order.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional dependencies are required.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place the Python script (`string_counter.py`) in the directory you want to use it.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python string_counter.py
   
## Example
Enter the directory path to scan: /path/to/your/directory
word1: 15
